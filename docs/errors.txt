Bug Report
==========

Error 1:
  Class: FriendRecommender
  Method: makeRecommendations()
  Test Method: testTwoFriends()
  Message: Wrong recommendation count

Error 2:
  Class: User
  Method: find()
  Test Method: testWithValidUser()
  Message: Return does not match the expected result.
  Apparently, the expected result is null instead of
  the User object.

Error 3:
  Class: User
  Method: unfriend()
  Test Method: testUnfriend()
  Message: (AssertionFailedError)
  One of the assertions returned true
  instead of false due to one of the user objects
  remaining in the adj of their ex-friend.


Error 4:
  Class: User
  Method: leave()
  Test Method: testLeave()
  Message: (AssertionFailedError)
  The method successfully removes the user
  but also removes their friends. One of
  the assertions, checking if their
  friends are still users returns false
  instead of true.

Error 5:
  Class: User
  Method: isFriend()
  Test Method: testIsFriendWithFriendship()
  Message: (AssertionFailedError) isFriend()
  returns false even though the two users
  are established friends.

Error 6:
  Class: User
  Method: isFriend()
  Test Method: testIsFriendWithoutFriendship()
  Message: (AssertionFailedError) isFriend()
  returns true when users are not friends.

Error 7:
Class: FriendRecommender
Method: makeRecommendations
Test Method: testMakeRecommendations()
Message: (Index 0 out of bounds for length 0) No
suggestion was added to the al list and therefore
nothing could be returned. Then I added an
assertEquals() method to check the length of al,
and it was in fact 0.
